**1. What is a fundamental characteristic of arrays in Java?** 

a) They can store multiple values of different data types under a single variable name.

` `b) Their length can be resized dynamically after declaration. 

c) All elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. 

d) They are primarily used for managing tasks in daily life without any specific data type.

Correct Answer: c) All elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.

**2. In Java, what is the primary difference between static and dynamic array initialization?** 

a) Static initialization defines the size first and inserts values later, while dynamic provides values during declaration. 

b) Static initialization provides values during the declaration itself, while dynamic defines the size first and inserts values later. 

c) Static arrays are used for primitive types, and dynamic arrays are used for object types. 

d) Static arrays require a catalog, while dynamic arrays do not.

Correct Answer: b) Static initialization provides values during the declaration itself, while dynamic defines the size first and inserts values later.

**3. What index does the first element of a Java array typically have?** 

a) 1. 

b) -1. 

c) 0. 

d) Varies depending on the array type.

Correct Answer: c) 0.

**4. Which built-in property is used to determine the number of elements in a Java array?** 

a) .size().

` `b) .count(). 

c) .length. 

d) .capacity().

Correct Answer: c) `.length`.

**5. Why is the sorting algorithm described as "Bubble Sort"?** 

a) Because it sorts elements by creating "bubbles" of sorted data. 

b) Because it compares elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, causing larger elements to "bubble" to the end of the list. 

c) Because it randomly sorts elements, similar to bubbles in a liquid. 

d) Because it involves placing elements into "buckets" or "bubbles".

Correct Answer: b) Because it compares elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, causing larger elements to "bubble" to the end of the list.

**6. What is the fundamental approach of Linear Search when looking for an element in an array?** 

a) It divides the array into halves until the element is found. 

b) It jumps to random positions in the array until the element is found. 

c) It checks each element one by one, starting from the beginning, until the desired element is found or the end of the array is reached. 

d) It requires the array to be sorted first to efficiently find the element.

Correct Answer: c) It checks each element one by one, starting from the beginning, until the desired element is found or the end of the array is reached .

**7. Which of the following is a disadvantage of using Linear Search for large datasets?** 

a) It is complex to implement. 

b) It requires the array to be sorted beforehand. 

c) It is slow because it may scan the entire array even if the element is near the end or not present. 

d) It only works with numeric data types.

Correct Answer: c) It is slow because it may scan the entire array even if the element is near the end or not present .

**8. Which real-life analogy best describes "dynamic initialization" of an array?** 

a) Packing a fixed lunchbox with 5 known items. 

b) Designing a building plan where Java needs to allocate memory separately. 

c) Setting 5 chairs for a party without knowing who will attend, then assigning seats as people arrive. 

d) Naming a pet, where the syntax flexibility doesn't change the meaning.

Correct Answer: c) Setting 5 chairs for a party without knowing who will attend, then assigning seats as people arrive .

**9. The analogy of searching for a specific book on a messy shelf by picking each book and reading its title from left to right, then stopping if found or giving up if the end is reached, illustrates which concept?** 

a) Bubble Sort. 

b) Static Initialization. 

c) Linear Search. 

d) Using the .length attribute.

Correct Answer:c) Linear Search .

**10. According to the notes, regarding the placement of brackets in Java array declarations (e.g., int ar[]; or int[] ar;), what is true?** 

a) Only int[] ar; is valid Java syntax. 

b) Only int ar[]; is valid Java syntax. 

c) Both declarations are valid and have the same meaning. 

d) The placement of brackets determines if the array is statically or dynamically initialized.

Correct Answer: c) Both declarations are valid and have the same meaning.
