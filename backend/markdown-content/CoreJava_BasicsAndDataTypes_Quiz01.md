Advanced Level Questions

1\.**Question:** The distinction between primitive and reference data types is crucial in Java primarily for which reasons?

A) Simplifying syntax and reducing boilerplate code.

B) Managing memory efficiently, optimising performance, and preventing errors.

C) Enabling dynamic typing at runtime.

D) Primarily supporting functional programming paradigms.

**Correct Answer:** B

2\.**Question:** When a reference variable is passed as an argument to a method, what is copied, and what is the potential implication of changes made inside the method?

A) The actual object is copied; changes inside the method cannot affect the original object.

B) The actual object is copied; changes inside the method always affect the original object.

C) The reference (address) is copied; changes made inside the method can affect the original object.

D) The reference (address) is copied; changes made inside the method cannot affect the original object.

**Correct Answer:** C

3\.**Question:** Java is described as a "strongly typed" and "statically typed" language. What does this imply about variable declaration and type-checking?

A) Variables can change their data type during runtime, and type-checking occurs at runtime.

B) Each variable must be declared with a data type, and type-checking is enforced at compile time.

C) Data types are inferred by the compiler, and no explicit declaration is needed.

D) Type errors are ignored, leading to more flexible code.

**Correct Answer:** B

4\.**Question:** Why does Java provide "wrapper classes" like Integer, Double, and Boolean for primitive types?

A) To reduce memory usage of primitive types.

B) To allow primitive types to be treated as objects, especially in contexts like collections.

C) To make primitive types mutable.

D) To convert primitive types to reference types automatically at compile time.

**Correct Answer:** B
